All benefits will cease upon termination of employment, subject to applicable law.</li><br/>
                    <li><b><u>Garden Leave:</u></b> If either you or the Company have given notice of termination or resignation, the Company may place you on “garden leave.”  While on garden leave, the Company may: (a) require you to carry out different duties from your normal duties; (b) require you not to attend at work; (c) require you to cease carrying out your duties altogether or cease having any business dealings with the Company’s employees, consultants, suppliers, customers and prospective customers; and/or (d) exclude you from any premises of the Company or any Group Company.  During such period, you will continue to receive your salary and all contractual benefits provided by your employment, and you must continue to comply with Section 13 below.</li><br>
