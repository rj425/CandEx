<h4 align="center">INDIA</h4>
<p style="text-align:justify">In consideration of my employment or continued employment by ViaSat India Private Limited (the &ldquo;<strong>Company</strong>&rdquo;), or in the future by any of its current or future parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, successors or assigns (collectively, including the Company, the &ldquo;<strong>Group Company</strong>&rdquo;), and in consideration of my employment with the Company and my receipt of the compensation now and hereafter paid to me by the Company, the adequacy of which is hereby acknowledged, I agree to the following (the &ldquo;<strong>Agreement</strong>&rdquo;):</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
    <li><b>NONDISCLOSURE</b><br/><br/>
        <ol style="text-align:justify;">
          <li><b>Recognition of Group Company's Rights; Nondisclosure.</b> In the course of my employment, I will have, or currently have, access to Proprietary Information (defined below) belonging to the Group Company, which is the property of the Group Company and entrusted to me in the course of my employment in confidence. At all times during my employment and thereafter, I will hold in strictest confidence and will not disclose, use, lecture upon or publish any of the Group Company's Proprietary Information, except as such disclosure, use or publication may be required in connection with my work for the Group Company, or unless an officer of the Group Company expressly authorizes such disclosure in writing. I will obtain Group Company's written approval before publishing or submitting for publication any material (written, verbal, or otherwise) that relates to my work at Group Company and/or that incorporates any Proprietary Information.  I will not remove any Proprietary Information from Group Company premises, nor shall I make copies, excerpts or summaries of Proprietary Information except as necessary to perform services as per my employment with the Company. I hereby assign to the Company any rights I may have or acquire in such Proprietary Information and recognize that all Proprietary Information shall be the sole property of the Group Company and its assigns.  Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to restrict an employee or contractor from lawfully reporting waste, fraud or abuse to a designated investigative or law enforcement representative of a government department or agency authorized to receive such information. </li><br/>
          <li><strong>Proprietary Information.</strong> The term "Proprietary Information" shall mean any and all confidential and/or proprietary knowledge, data or information of the Group Company, and information and physical material entrusted to the Group Company in confidence by third parties. By way of illustration but not limitation,&nbsp; &ldquo;<strong>Proprietary Information&rdquo;</strong> includes (a) trade secrets, inventions, mask works, ideas, processes, formulas, source and object codes, data, programs, other works of authorship, know-how, improvements, discoveries, developments, designs and techniques (hereinafter collectively referred to as &ldquo;<strong>Inventions</strong>&rdquo;); and (b) information regarding plans for research, development, new products, marketing and selling, business plans, budgets and unpublished financial statements, licenses, prices and costs, suppliers&nbsp; and&nbsp; customers;&nbsp; and&nbsp; (c)&nbsp; information regarding the skills and compensation of other employees of the Group Company to the maximum extent protectable by law.&nbsp; Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is understood that, at all such times, I am free to use information which is generally known in the trade or industry, which is not gained as result of a breach of this Agreement, and my own, skill, knowledge, know-how and experience to whatever extent and in whichever way I wish.</li><br>
          <li><strong>Third Party Information.</strong> I understand, in addition, that the Group Company has received, and in the future, will receive, from third parties confidential or proprietary information (&ldquo;<strong>Third Party Information&rdquo;</strong>) subject to a duty on the Group Company's part to maintain the confidentiality of such information and to use it only for certain limited purposes. During the term of my employment and thereafter, I will hold Third Party Information in the strictest confidence and will not disclose to anyone (other than Group Company personnel who need to know such information in connection with their work for the Group Company) or otherwise use Third Party Information, except in connection with my work for the Group Company, unless expressly authorized by an officer of the Group Company in writing.</li><br/>
          <li><strong>No Improper Use of Information of Prior Employers and Others.</strong> During my employment by the Group Company, I will not improperly use or disclose any confidential information or trade secrets of any former employer, or any other person or entity to whom I have a lawful obligation of confidentiality, if any, and I will not bring onto the premises of the Group Company any unpublished documents or any property belonging to any former employer or any other person to whom I have an obligation of confidentiality unless consented to in writing by that former employer or person.&nbsp; I will use in the performance of my duties for the Group Company only information which is generally known and used by persons with training and experience comparable to my own, which is common knowledge in the industry or otherwise legally in the public domain, or which is otherwise provided or developed by the Group Company.</li><br/>
          <li><strong>Other Rights.</strong> This Agreement is intended to supplement, and not to supersede, any rights the Group Company may have in law or equity with respect to the protection of trade secrets or confidential or proprietary information.</li><br/>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li><b>ASSIGNMENT OF INVENTIONS</b><br/><br/>
        <ol style="text-align:justify;">
          <li><strong>Proprietary Rights.</strong> The term &ldquo;<strong>Proprietary Rights</strong>&rdquo; shall mean all trade secret, patent, copyright, mask work and other intellectual property rights throughout the world.</li><br/>
          <li><strong>Prior Inventions.</strong> Inventions, if any, patented or unpatented, which I made prior to the commencement of my employment with the Company are excluded from the scope of this Agreement. To preclude any possible uncertainty, I have set forth on <em>Exhibit A </em>(Previous Inventions) attached hereto a complete list of all Inventions that I have, alone or jointly with others, conceived, developed or reduced to practice or caused to be conceived, developed or reduced to practice prior to the commencement of my employment with the Company, that I consider to be my property or the property of third parties and that I wish to have excluded from the scope of this Agreement (collectively referred to as &ldquo;<strong>Prior Inventions</strong>&rdquo;). If disclosure of any such Prior Invention would cause me to violate any prior confidentiality agreement, I understand that I am not to list such Prior Inventions in <em>Exhibit A </em>but am only to disclose a cursory name for each such invention, a listing of the party(ies) to whom it belongs, and shall indicate the fact that full disclosure as to such inventions has not been made because of a prior confidentiality agreement. A space is provided on <em>Exhibit A </em>for such purpose. If no such disclosure is attached, I represent that there are no Prior Inventions. To the extent such Prior Inventions do exist and are not listed on <em>Exhibit&nbsp;A</em>, I hereby forever waive any and all rights or claims of ownership to such Inventions. If, in the course of my employment with the Group Company, I incorporate a Prior Invention into a Group Company product, process or machine, the Company is hereby granted and shall have a nonexclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable, perpetual, worldwide license (with rights to sublicense through multiple tiers of sublicensees) to make, have made, modify, use and sell such Prior Invention. Notwithstanding the foregoing, I will not incorporate, or permit to be incorporated, Prior Inventions in any Group Company Inventions without the Group Company's prior written consent. Whether or not I give such notice, I hereby irrevocably grant to the Company a nonexclusive, fully paid-up, royalty-free, assumable, worldwide license, valid for the duration of the protection of the intellectual property rights attached to the Prior Inventions, with right to transfer and to sublicense, to practice and exploit such Prior Invention and to make, have made, copy, modify, make derivative works of, use, sell, import, and otherwise distribute such Prior Invention under all applicable intellectual property laws without restriction of any kind.&nbsp; I understand and agree that it is my responsibility, and solely my responsibility, to ensure that any such Prior Inventions that I incorporate into a Group Company product, process and/or machine can indeed be incorporated therein, that such incorporation does not violate any commitments made by me to any third parties, and that any rights stipulated in this provision to be granted to Group Company can indeed be granted to Group Company, notwithstanding any other joint owners of such Prior Inventions.&nbsp; I also understand and agree that I shall indemnify Group Company against any costs or damages, etc. that may arise if I do not ascertain such rights to be granted or otherwise fail to meet my obligations under this provision.</li><br/>
          <li><strong>Assignment of Inventions.</strong> Subject to Sections 2.2 above and 2.5 below, I hereby assign and will assign in the future (when any such Inventions or Proprietary Rights are first reduced to practice or first fixed in a tangible medium, as applicable) to the Company, or its designee, all my right, title and interest in and to any and all Inventions (and all Proprietary Rights with respect thereto) whether or not patentable or registrable under copyright or similar statutes, made or conceived or reduced to practice or learned by me, either alone or jointly with others, during the period of my employment with the Company. Inventions assigned to the Company, or to a third party as directed by the Company pursuant to this Section 2, are hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;Company Inventions<strong>.&rdquo; </strong></li><br/>
          <li><strong>Obligation to Keep Company Informed.</strong> During the period of my employment, and for six (6) months after termination of my employment with the Company, I will promptly disclose to the Company fully and in writing all Inventions authored, conceived or reduced to practice by me, either alone or jointly with others. In addition, I will promptly disclose to the Company all patent applications filed by me or on my behalf within a year after termination of employment. The Company will keep in confidence and will not use for any purpose or disclose to third parties without my consent any confidential information disclosed in writing to the Company pursuant to this Agreement relating to Inventions.</li><br/>
          <li><strong>Government or Third Party.</strong> I hereby assign all my right, title and interest in and to any particular Company Invention to a third party, including without limitation India, the United States, or any other country, as directed by the Group Company.</li><br/>
          <li><strong>Works for Hire.</strong> I acknowledge that all original works of authorship which are made by me (solely or jointly with others) within the scope of my employment and which are protectable by copyright are &ldquo;works made for hire&rdquo; pursuant to applicable law and are compensated by my salary. I hereby waive and irrevocably quitclaim to the Company or its designee any and all claims, of any nature whatsoever, that I now have or may hereafter have for infringement of any and all Company Inventions. Any assignment of Company Inventions includes all rights of attribution, paternity, integrity, modification, disclosure and withdrawal, and any other rights throughout the world that may be known as or referred to as &ldquo;moral rights,&rdquo; &ldquo;artist&rsquo;s rights,&rdquo; &ldquo;droit moral,&rdquo; or the like (collectively, &ldquo;<strong><u>Moral Rights</u></strong>&rdquo;).&nbsp; To the extent that Moral Rights cannot be assigned under applicable law, I hereby waive and agree not to enforce any and all Moral Rights, including, without limitation, any limitation on subsequent modification, to the extent permitted under applicable law.</li><br/>
          <li><strong>Enforcement of Proprietary Rights.</strong> I will assist the Company in every proper way to obtain, and from time to time enforce, United States, Indian, and foreign Proprietary Rights relating to Company Inventions and any copyrights, patents, trademarks, mask work rights, Moral Rights, or other intellectual property rights relating thereto in any and all countries. To that end, I will execute, verify, and deliver such documents and perform such other acts (including making appearances as a witness) as the Group Company may reasonably request for use in applying for, obtaining, perfecting, evidencing, sustaining and enforcing such Proprietary Rights and the assignment thereof. I also will execute promptly, both during and after the end of the business relationship with the Company, any proper oath, and to verify any proper document, required to carry out the terms of this Agreement, upon the Company&rsquo;s written request to do so. In addition, I will execute, verify, and deliver assignments of such Proprietary Rights to the Company or its designee. My obligation to assist the Company with respect to Proprietary Rights relating to such Company Inventions in any and all countries shall continue beyond the termination of my employment, but the Company shall compensate me at a reasonable rate after my termination for the time actually spent by me at the Company's request on such assistance.</li><br/>
          <p style="text-align:justify;">In the event the Company is unable for any reason, after reasonable effort, to secure my signature on any document needed in connection with the actions specified in the preceding paragraph, I hereby irrevocably designate and appoint the Company and its duly authorized officers and agents as my agent and attorney in fact, which appointment is coupled with an interest, to act for and in my behalf to execute, verify, and file any such documents and to do all other lawfully permitted acts to further the purposes of the preceding paragraph with the same legal force and effect as if executed by me.  I hereby waive and quitclaim to the Company any and all claims, of any nature whatsoever, which I now or may hereafter have for infringement of any Proprietary Rights assigned hereunder to the Company.</p>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li><b>RECORDS.</b> I will keep and maintain adequate and current records (in the form of notes, sketches, drawings or in any other form that may be required by the Group Company) of all Proprietary Information developed by me and all Inventions made by me during the period of my employment at the Group Company, which records shall be available to and remain the sole property of the Group Company at all times.</li><br/>
    <li><b>NO INCONSISTENT OBLIGATION.</b> I represent that my performance of all the terms of this Agreement and as an employee of the Company does not and will not breach any agreement to keep in confidence information acquired by me in confidence or in trust prior to my employment by the Company. I have not entered into, and I agree I will not enter into, any agreement either written or oral in conflict herewith.</li><br/>
    <li><b>NON-SOLICIT.</b> As described above, I acknowledge and agree that Proprietary Information includes information relating to the Group Company's employees, consultants, customers and others, and that I will not use or disclose such Proprietary Information except as authorized by the Company. I further agree as follows:<br/><br/>
        <ol style="text-align:justify;">
          <li><b>Non-Solicit of Employees and Consultants.</b> I agree that during the term of my employment with the Company, and for a period of twelve (12) months immediately following the termination of my employment for any reason, whether with or without cause, I will not either directly or indirectly solicit, induce, recruit or encourage any of the Group Company’s employees or consultants to terminate their relationship with the Group Company, or attempt to solicit, induce, recruit, encourage or take away employees or consultants of the Group Company, either for myself or for any other person or entity.</li><br/>
          <li><b>Non-Solicit of Other Parties.</b> I agree that during the term of my employment with the Company, and for a period of twelve (12) months immediately following the termination of my employment for any reason, whether with or without cause, I will not use any Proprietary Information to negatively influence any of the Group Company’s clients or customers from purchasing Group Company products or services or to solicit or influence or attempt to influence any client, customer or other person either directly or indirectly, to direct any purchase of products and/or services to any person, firm, corporation, institution or other entity in competition with the business of the Group Company.</li><br/>
          <p style="text-align:justify;">I also acknowledge and agree that damages will not be an adequate compensation for any breach of my obligations hereunder this Section 5, and I hereby consent and agree to the application, in the event of such breach, by the Company for equitable remedies (including, without limitation, injunctive relief) for any breach.</p>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li><strong>RETURN OF GROUP COMPANY DOCUMENTS.</strong> When I leave the employ of the Company, I will deliver to the Company any and all drawings, notes, memoranda, specifications, devices, formulas, and documents, together with all copies thereof, and any other material containing or disclosing any Company Inventions, Third Party Information or Proprietary Information of the Group Company. I further agree that any property situated on the Company's premises and owned by the Group Company, including computers, hard drives and other storage media, filing cabinets or other work areas, is subject to inspection by Group Company personnel at any time with or without notice. Prior to leaving, I will cooperate with the Group Company in completing and signing the Company&rsquo;s termination statement [(attached hereto as <em>Exhibit B</em>)].</li><br/>
    <li><strong>LEGAL AND EQUITABLE REMEDIES.</strong> Because my services are personal and unique, and because I may have access to and become acquainted with the Proprietary Information of the Group Company, the Group Company shall have the right to enforce this Agreement and any of its provisions by injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief, without bond and without prejudice to any other rights and remedies that the Group Company may have for a breach of this Agreement, subject to applicable law.</li><br/>
    <li><strong>NOTICES.</strong> Any notices required or permitted to be given to Group Company hereunder shall be sent to ViaSat, Inc., c/o General Counsel, 6155 El Camino Real, Carlsbad, California 92009, or at such other address as Group Company shall specify in writing.&nbsp; Such notice shall be deemed given upon personal delivery to the appropriate address or, if sent by certified or registered mail, three (3) days after the date of mailing.</li><br>
    <li><strong>NOTIFICATION OF NEW EMPLOYER</strong>. In the event that I leave the employ of the Company, I hereby consent to the notification of my new employer of my rights and obligations under this Agreement.</li><br/>
    <li><b>GENERAL PROVISIONS.</b><br/><br/>
        <ol style="text-align:justify;">
          <li><strong>Governing Law; Consent to Personal Jurisdiction.</strong> The validity, interpretation, construction and performance of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of India, and any dispute that cannot be resolved by the parties shall be submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Chennai, Tamil Nadu.</li><br/>
          <li><strong>Severability.</strong> In case any one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement shall, for any reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect the other provisions of this Agreement, and this Agreement shall be construed as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never been contained herein. If moreover, any one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement shall for any reason be held to be excessively broad as to duration, geographical scope, activity or subject, it shall be construed by limiting and reducing it, so as to be enforceable to the extent compatible with the applicable law as it shall then appear. I further acknowledge and agree that the restrictions contained in Section 5 are considered by the Company and me to be reasonable in all circumstances. However, should a court of competent jurisdiction determine that the scope of the covenants contained in Section&nbsp;5 exceeds the maximum restrictiveness such court deems reasonable and enforceable, the parties intend that the court should reform, modify and enforce the provision to such narrower scope as it determines to be reasonable and enforceable under the circumstances existing at that time.</li><br/>
          <li><b>Successors and Assigns.</b> This Agreement will be binding upon my heirs, executors, administrators and other legal representatives and will be for the benefit of the Group Company, its successors, and its assigns.</li><br/>
          <li><b>Survival.</b> The provisions of this Agreement shall survive the termination of my employment with the Company, and shall also survive the assignment of this Agreement by the Group Company to any successor in interest or other assignee.</li><br/>
          <li><b>Employment.</b> I agree and understand that nothing in this Agreement shall confer any right with respect to continuation of employment by the Company, nor shall it interfere in any way with my right or the Company’s right to terminate my employment at any time, with or without cause in accordance with applicable law.</li><br/>
          <li><b>Waiver.</b> No waiver by the Group Company of any breach of this Agreement shall be a waiver of any preceding or succeeding breach. No waiver by the Group Company of any right under this Agreement shall be construed as a waiver of any other right.  The Group Company shall not be required to give notice to enforce strict adherence to all terms of this Agreement.</li><br/>
          <li><b>Voluntary Execution.</b> I certify and acknowledge that I have carefully read all of the provisions of this Agreement, that I understand and have voluntarily accepted such provisions, and that I will fully and faithfully comply with such provisions.</li><br/>
          <li><b>Translation.</b> To the extent this Agreement or any related documentation has been provided to in a language other than English, the English language version will govern in case of any ambiguities or inconsistencies, subject to applicable law.</li><br/>
          <li><b>Entire Agreement.</b> This Agreement, along with my employment agreement is the final, complete, and exclusive agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes and merges all prior discussions between us.  No modification of or amendment to this Agreement, nor any waiver of any rights under this Agreement, will be effective unless in writing and signed by the party to be charged. Any subsequent change or changes in my duties, salary, or compensation will not affect the validity or scope of this Agreement.  The obligations pursuant to Sections 1 and 2 of this Agreement shall apply to any time during which I was previously hired by the Group Company as a consultant or independent contractor, or am in the future hired by the Group Company as a consultant or independent contractor, if no other valid agreement with the Group Company governs nondisclosure and assignment of inventions during such a time period.  </li><br/>
          <li><b>Advice of Counsel.</b> I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT, IN EXECUTING THIS AGREEMENT, I HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEEK THE ADVICE OF INDEPENDENT LEGAL COUNSEL, AND I HAVE READ AND UNDERSTOOD ALL OF THE TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT.
